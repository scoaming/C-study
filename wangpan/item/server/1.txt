                           The Necessity of Examination

As regards examination, there has been a heated discussion among the general public in our society. People who believe in its necessity may have some arguments as follows. To begin with, examination helps to tell the better-behaved from the worse-behaved students. What’s more, examination may stimulate the students to work harder. Take Xiao Wang as an example, a student from Hebei Normal University, he used to have poor command of English. However, under the pressure of College English Test Band 4, he made great progress and can now speak fluent English.

By contrast, some people think that examination may give rise to a series of negative effects. They maintain that examination cannot always faithfully reflect one’s study performance. It is believed that too many students may be misled and neglect the improvement of practical ability. Examples of “High marks but poor competence” are often cited on different media.

Just as any coin has two sides; it’s no exception with the issue of examination. Students should develop a right attitude towards it and strike a balance between examination and practical ability achievement.
